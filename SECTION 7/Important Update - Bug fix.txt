Important Update - Bug fix
Hello all,

There's been an update to the code which applies to the MNIST section of this course. When normalizing the images, make sure to write transforms.Normalize((0.5,), (0.5,))  , rather than what we had earlier, transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5)) . Ultimately, this is done to ensure a single channel of (1, 28, 28), rather than (3, 28, 28). 



Let me know if you have any questions about this.

Best,

Rayan and Team.
